# Flexbox and Grid Layout Project
Created with CodeSandbox

## Description

In this project, I focused on understanding the different parts of the CSS box model and how they affect elements. I practiced using Flexbox to control the positioning and distribution of elements and CSS Grid to create more complex layouts. 

The goal was to:
- Learn to use Flexbox for aligning and distributing elements with properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` (e.g., `center`, `space-between`, `flex-start`).
- Implement CSS Grid for creating layouts with `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`, and use `fr` units to distribute space proportionally.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, CSS Grid)
  
## Features

- Flexbox-based layout for flexible positioning and distribution of items.
- Grid-based layout for more complex, responsive designs with defined columns and rows.
